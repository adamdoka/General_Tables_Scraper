# General Table Scraper

The project's goal is to have a scraper tool which can be fairly generally applied to a wider variety of sources. The script can handle multiple websites (saving tables with the same column headers into one table) as well as save URLs and image references from the cells in case they are present.

## Prerequisites

The script was developed in Jupyter Notebook and was tested with Python 3.5.3. All the necessary libraries can be found in the 1st cell.

## Usage

The main parameters of the script are set up in the 2nd cell, but further options can be commented in/out further down in the script.
